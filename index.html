                <p>
                    I'm a field service engineer with experience working with ATMs, currency-handling machines, EPOS solutions, and in IT.
                    I'm currently contracting for Barron McCann IT Services, introducing new EPOS hardware to retail stores.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Prior to field engineering work, I studied Games Design in university, later going on to study games development,
                    IT, music technology, 3D modelling, and web development as a hobby while working full time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my spare time, I like to play PC games, namely Overwatch, Tom Clancy's The Division 2, and Pokémon, among others.
                    I also like to experiment with HTML templates and use them to put together static websites, like this one,
                    where I upload written works on topics of interest to me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’ve implemented upgrades and applied modifications to EPOS systems in retail establishments and ATM machines across the UK
                    in order to improve their services or prepare them for advancements in technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My work has increased the security, efficiency and speed of these machines, and enabled communication of critical information.
                    It’s also improved accessibility for my colleagues during their visits, reducing their time spent on site.
                    Additionally, it’s reduced these sites’ power consumption and customer wait times, and improved the customer-facing experience for staff and customers alike.
                </p>

                <h3>My personal experience</h3>

                <p>
                    As an engineer, I travel all over the country, usually working in a different location every day.
                    I meet and interact with new people at each site, where I introduce (or prepare to introduce) new hardware and software solutions to end clients.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The days are often unpredictable: I’m always learning something new, broadening my knowledge of IT and of the hardware and software I work with,
                    especially when things don’t go to plan.
                </p>

                <p>In terms of experience, I get to work for a wide variety of IT and ATM service providers through multiple employment agencies.</p>

                <p>
                    I'm a fully self-taught IT technician, and have been since 2009. This kicked off with a work experience placement in PC repair after secondary school, 
                    closely followed by my first custom PC build.
                </p>

                <p>As a technician, I’ve managed to save time and money by eliminating the need for any personal visits to computer repair shops,
                or home visits from IT technicians for installation of electronic devices, by conducting these works at home.</p>

                <p>The self-teaching and the experience with IT hardware, encompassing works for myself, friends, family, and paying clients,                
                has been a major asset to me as an IT engineer.</p>

                <p>The job involves a lot of work with IT equipment including computers and their peripherals and equipment in comms cabinets, 
                as well as swapping out computer components.</p>

                <p>For more information on my field engineering career, see the ‘ATM/EPOS’ button on the navigation bar, as well as my CV.</p>

                <h2 class="major">IT Sales</h2>

                <span class="image main"><img src="bcm logo blue.png" alt="" /></span>

                <p>The process of building my first desktop PC in 2009 required me to conduct extensive research on the subject (it was a different time).</p>

                <p>Since then, I've honed my problem-solving skills in order to match friends, family and clients with the hardware and software solutions best suited to them.</p>

                <h3>Experience</h3>

                <p>Further research into IT hardware and software has helped me develop my IT skills and improved my decision making with regards to product selection for customers.</p>

                <p>
                    This has allowed me to reduce costs and eliminated wastage of funds at the mid-range and beyond,
                    by selecting computer components tailored to specific customer requirements in order to build computers,
                    or by using online custom configurators to build and purchase them.
                </p>

                <p>For general-purpose and business desktop solutions, I find that prebuilt machines offered by desktop computer manufacturers are often the way to go.</p>

                <p>As a salesperson I take a lot into account when choosing hardware:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Price-to-performance ratios to calculate the costs of, and either justify or oppose, marginal increases in performance</li>
                    <li>Compatibility, power consumption, ventilation and cooling, noise mitigation, and futureproofing</li>
                    <li>Programs that favour certain types of microprocessors</li>
                    <li>Storage space requirements for workstations or gaming systems</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I’ve upgraded my personal computer many times, and have used the older components to build general-purpose systems for family members.
                    I’ve also selected desktop computers, peripherals, displays, smartphones, and other electronic devices for purchase for my household.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’ve fully integrated Apple iPhone users into the Apple ecosystem by switching them from Windows PCs to Apple Macs at their request,
                    by locating used Macs suitable for their individual use cases at a reasonable price, then installing and configuring them for use with their iPhones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Perhaps most importantly, I have demonstrated an understanding of individual customers’ requirements, needs, and desires,
                    and not let my own biases or preferences affect a potential sale.
                </p>
